<div class="chapter"><h2>AN ATTEMPT TO ANALYSE, &amp;c.</h2></div>

<p>The Automaton Chess Player was first introduced into England by Mr. de
Kempelen, its inventer, about the year 1783. It was brought again into
this country two years ago, and exhibited under the direction of a very
ingenious gentleman, Mr. Maelzel.</p>

<p>The annexed drawings, (plate 1, figs. 1 and 2,) represent the general
appearance of the machine. It runs on castors, and is either seen
on the floor when the doors of the apartment are thrown open, or is
wheeled into the room at the commencement of the exhibition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The exhibiter, in order to shew the mechanism, as he informs the
spectators, unlocks the door (<a href="#FIG_1"><span class="smcap">a</span>, fig. 1</a>.)
of the chest, which exposes to view a small cupboard, lined with black or dark coloured
cloth, and containing different pieces of machinery, which seem to
occupy the whole space. He next opens the door (<span class="smcap">b</span>,
<a href="#FIG_2">fig. 2</a>.) at the back of the same cupboard, and, holding a lighted
candle at the opening, still further exposes the machinery within. The candle being
withdrawn, the door (<span class="smcap">b</span>) is then locked. The drawer
(<a href="#FIG_1"><span class="smcap">g g</span>, fig. 1</a>.) in the front of the chest is
next opened, and a set of chess men, a small box of counters, and a cushion for the support
of the Automaton’s arm, are taken out of it. The exhibiter now opens the
two front doors (<a href="#FIG_1"><span class="smcap">c c</span>, fig. 1</a>.) of the large cupboard,
and the back door (<a href="#FIG_2"><span class="smcap">d</span>, fig. 2</a>.) of the same, and
applies a candle as in the former case. This cupboard is lined with cloth like the other, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
it contains only a few pieces of machinery. The chest is now wheeled
round, the garments of the figure are lifted up, and the door
(<a href="#FIG_1"><span class="smcap">e</span>, fig. 2</a>,) in the trunk, and another (<span class="smcap">f</span>,)
in the thigh, are opened. But it must be observed that the doors (<span class="smcap">b</span>
and <span class="smcap">d</span>) are closed. The circumstance is mentioned, because
Mr. de Windisch, in his letters on this subject, has a passage which
would seem to imply that Mr. Maelzel’s mode of exhibiting the interior
differs from that which Mr. de Kempelen employed. “But do not imagine,”
says De Windisch, “like many others, that the inventer shuts one door
as he opens another; the entire Automaton is seen at the same time
uncovered, his garments turned up, and the drawer opened, as well as
all the doors of the chest.”</p>

<p>Now a reference to De Kempelen’s second drawing, published by Mechel,
and annexed to De Windisch’s letters, will shew that, when the chest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
was turned round, the doors (<span class="smcap">b</span> and <span class="smcap">d</span>)
were actually closed, as they always have been under the direction of Mr. Maelzel.
In the chest of the latter gentleman, indeed, the doors in question
are suspended by hinges attached to the upper part, (<a href="#FIG_2">as in fig. 2</a>),
and consequently close by their own gravity. But the fact is, that the
exhibiter never fails to lock them, though he leaves the keys in one of
the locks. The other doors are allowed to swing about whilst the chest
is wheeled round.</p>

<p>The chest is now restored to its former position on the floor; the
doors in front, and the drawer, are closed and locked; and the
exhibiter, after he has occupied some time at the back of the chest, in
apparently adjusting the machinery, removes the pipe from the hand of
the figure, winds up the works, and the Automaton begins to move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
These movements, resulting as they appear to do, from mere mechanism,
yet strongly impressed with the distinctive character of an
intellectual guidance, have excited the admiration of the curious
during a period little short of forty years. In that time various
conjectures have been offered to the world as solutions of the problem;
but no one, as far as I know, have attempted to imitate the movements,
it is fair to conclude, either that the means proposed are inadequate
to the end, or that the description of them is too imperfect to enable
a workman to complete the machinery.</p>

<p>Automata may be divided into three classes—the simple—the
compound—and the spurious.</p>

<p>The first class comprises those insulated Automata whose movements
result from mechanism alone; by the aid of which they perform certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
actions, and continue them, so long as the moving force is kept in an
active state.</p>

<p>The second class includes those Automata, which, like the former, are
moved by machinery; but, possessing at the same time a communication,
not immediately apparent, with human agency, are enabled to change the
regular order and succession of their movements, according to existing
circumstances; and hence, in some measure, to assume the character of
living beings.</p>

<p>The third class contains those Automata which, under the semblance only
of mechanism, are wholly directed and controlled by a concealed human agent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
The phenomena of the Chess Player are inconsistent with the effects
of mere mechanism; for, however great and surprising the powers of
mechanism may be, the movements that spring from it, are necessarily
limited and uniform: it cannot usurp and exercise the faculties of
mind; it cannot be made to vary its operations, so as to meet the
ever-varying circumstances of a game of chess. This is the province of
intellect alone; and the Chess Player must consequently relinquish all
claim to be admitted into the first division. Let us examine its title
to be ranked in the second class.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The chess board contains sixty-four squares, and in order to execute
the movements of the Chess Player, distinct trains of machinery must be
formed, which shall be capable, when set in motion, of conveying the
hand of the Automaton to each, and to any, of these several squares.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Having arrived at a square, and taken up a chess man, it will be
requisite, either to withdraw the hand towards the side, and without
the limits of the board, for the purpose of letting drop the chess man
there, and thence to proceed to another square, and remove a chess man
to a third square; or it may be required to pass at once from the first
square to any other on the board, and there to deposit the man. These
movements must be promptly performed, and repeated as often as the
circumstances of the game may call for them.</p>

<p>Setting aside a great variety of minor details, it will be evident to
any person, even slightly acquainted with mechanics, that the execution
of these movements, so extensive, so complicated, and so variable,
would be attended with difficulties almost insurmountable; but we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
will suppose for a moment that these obstacles are overcome; let it
be conceded that a machine has been constructed so perfect, that, on
giving motion to the respective trains, the required movement shall
be instantly performed. What then? The main object will be still
unattained! Where is the intelligence and the “promethean heat” that
can animate the Automaton and direct its operations? Not only must
an intellectual agent be provided, but between such an agent and his
deputy, the Automaton, a direct communication must be formed and
preserved, liable to no interruption, and yet so secret that the
penetrating eye of the most inquisitive observer may not be able to
detect it. Till this be done, the Chess Player’s title to be admitted
into the second division will, at any rate, continue in abeyance.</p>

<p>I am aware that on this part of the subject conjecture has been busy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and different plans have been devised for the maintenance of the
intercourse alluded to. The task has been imposed on the exhibiter of
the machine, he being the only person on whom it could devolve with
even a shadow of probability; and to effect his purpose it has been
suggested that he might touch certain springs, or pull “a wire not
much thicker than a hair,” or be furnished with a powerful magnet. But
such conjectures are unworthy of serious refutation; for besides the
uncertainty and constant liability to interruption of such modes of
communication, they are actually at variance with the uniform conduct
of the exhibiter. Whoever has witnessed the exhibition will have seen
that the exhibiter is not confined to a particular spot in the room,
but, on the contrary, that he is frequently, during the progress of the
game, at a distance from the chest, far beyond the sphere of influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of any of these proposed modes; and if, at such times, the Automaton
can move a single joint, it is proof decisive that its action springs
from another source.</p>

<p>Having now shewn how difficult, and perhaps impossible, it would be to
execute the movements of the Chess Player by mechanism, and maintain,
at the same time, a communication with the agent, who would be required
to give life, as it were, and intelligence to the operations, it
becomes necessary to inquire whether the prevailing opinion, which
attributes these movements to machinery, be, or be not, established
in fact; for, if this opinion should be found, on examination, to
originate merely in the artful management and display of some parts of
the apparatus, and to rest on no solid basis, there would be no longer
any embarrassment in appreciating the real value of the Chess Player,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
nor in apportioning a proper station for it, considered as a work of art.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the exhibition the spectators are gratuitously
made acquainted with the interior of the chest, which is divided into
two unequal compartments, and occupied by pieces of machinery, so
arranged, as apparently to render the concealment of any human being
impossible. When the movements of the Automaton begin, the beholders,
in the first moments of surprise, and in the absence of any ostensible
living cause, very naturally refer the effect to the mechanism, which
has been exhibited; and with likelihood enough, for the movements
immediately follow the familiar action and well known sound of winding
up clockwork, and are moreover very skillfully accompanied by the
grating noise of moving wheels. But, these indications excepted, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
is the evidence that the machinery moves, or that the slightest
influence is exerted by it on the arm of the Automaton? The whole is
excluded from view, and a moment’s reflection will convince any one
that no stress can be laid on the winding up, nor on the accompanying
sounds, which are imitable in various ways.</p>

<p>If, however, no proof can be given of the actual movement of the
machinery, the following considerations will tend to shew that it
remains quiescent, and is probably not formed for motion.</p>

<p>An artist, whose talents had enabled him to contrive machinery capable
of executing the varied and extensive movements displayed by the
Automaton, would surely be desirous of laying open to view as much of
the mechanism of his contrivance, while in actual motion, as he could
do, consistently with the reservation of his secret; if for no other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
reason, at least to convince the lookers-on that deception formed no
part of his plan. Now it cannot be reasonably urged, in vindication
of the inventer’s forbearance, in the instance of the Chess Player,
that even a glance at any part of the machinery in motion would betray
the secret; for a question will immediately arise, Why then is the
machinery at rest so freely exposed? On that score no apprehension
seems to be entertained; the chest is ostentatiously opened, and the
semblance, at least, of wheels, and pullies, and levers, is submitted
to inspection without reserve: but when their reality should appear,
and their connection with the Automaton be made manifest, the doors
are carefully closed, and the spectators are required to pay large
drafts on their credulity, without any means of further examination.
The glaring contradiction between eager display on the one hand, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
studied concealment on the other, can only be reconciled by considering
the exhibition of the mechanism as a mere stratagem, calculated to
distract the attention, and mislead the judgment, of the spectators.</p>

<p>The truth of this opinion receives additional support from the regular
and undeviating mode of disclosing the interior of the chest. If the
mechanism were the real object in view, the whole being quiescent, it
would be matter of indifference which part was first laid open; and
accident alone, unless powerful reasons operated against it, would lead
occasionally to some variation. But no variation has ever been observed
to take place. One uniform order, or routine, is strictly adhered to,
and this circumstance alone is sufficient to awaken suspicion, for it
shews plainly that more is intended by the disclosure than is permitted
to meet the eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
It has already been suggested, that little stress could be laid on the
winding up: indeed the simple act of turning round a key or winder
can offer no argument in proof of the efficiency of the machinery,
unless at the same time it could be shewn that the key, in turning,
either acted upon a spring, or pulled up a weight, for the purpose of
giving motion to the machinery in question. But unluckily for the Chess
Player, the phenomena afford positive proof that the axis turned by the
key is quite free, and unconnected, either with a spring, or a weight,
or any system of machinery.</p>

<p>In all machines requiring to be wound up, two consequences are
inseparable from their construction: the first is, that, in winding up
the machinery, the key is limited in the number of its revolutions;
and the second is, that some relative proportion must be constantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
maintained betwixt the winding up and the work performed, in order to
enable the machine to continue its movements. Now these results are
not observable in the Chess Player; for the Automaton will sometimes
execute sixty-three moves with only one winding up; at other times
the exhibiter has been observed to repeat the winding up after seven
moves, and even three moves; and once, probably from inadvertence,
without the intervention of a single move; whilst, in every instance
and the circumstance, though trifling, calls for particular attention,
(for, in these matters, be it remembered, “trifles light as air, are
confirmations strong,”) the key appeared to perform the same number of
revolutions; evincing thereby, that the revolving axis was unconnected
with machinery, except, perhaps, a ratchet-wheel and click, or some
similar apparatus, to enable it to produce the necessary sounds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
consequently that the key, like that of a child’s watch, might be
turned, whenever the purposes of the exhibition seemed to require it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I shall now pass on to the third division, and point out a method by
which any person, well skilled in the game, and not exceeding the
ordinary bulk or stature, may secretly animate the Automaton, and
successfully imitate the movements of Mr. De Kempelen’s Chess Player.</p>

<p>The general plan and dimensions of the chest will be understood by
inspecting the plates, but some particulars, relative to the interior,
will require further explanation.</p>

<p>The drawer (<span class="smcap">gg</span>, plate 5,) when closed, does not reach to the
back of the chest; it leaves a space (<span class="smcap">o</span>) behind it, about 1
foot 2 inches broad, 8 inches high, and 3 feet 11 inches long. This
space is never exposed to view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
The small cupboard is divided into two parts by the door or screen
(<a href="#FIG_6"><span class="smcap">i</span>, fig. 6</a>,) which is moveable on a hinge, and is so
contrived that when <span class="smcap">b</span> is closed, this screen may be closed also. The
machinery (<span class="smcap">h</span>) occupies the whole of the front division as far
as <span class="smcap">i</span>; the hinder division is nearly empty, and communicates
with the space behind the drawer, the floor of this division being
removed.</p>

<p>The back of the great cupboard is double, and the part (<span class="smcap">p
q</span>,) to which the quadrants, &amp;c. are attached, moves on a joint
(<span class="smcap">q</span>), at the upper part, and forms, when raised, an opening
(<span class="smcap">s</span>) between the two cupboards, by carrying with it part of the
partition (<span class="smcap">r</span>), which is composed of cloth stretched tight.
<a href="#FIG_10">Fig. 10</a> shews the false back closed. <a href="#FIG_11">Fig. 11</a>
shews the same raised, forming the opening (<span class="smcap">s</span>) between the chambers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
When the trunk of the figure is exposed by lifting up the dress, it
will be seen that a great part of it is occupied by an inner trunk
(<span class="smcap">n</span>), which passes off towards the back in the form
of an arch, (<a href="#FIG_2">fig. 2</a>), and conceals a portion of the interior
from the view of the spectators. This inner trunk opens to the chest by an aperture
(<a href="#FIG_9"><span class="smcap">t</span>, fig. 9</a>), about 1 foot 3 inches
high, by 1 foot broad.</p>

<p>When the false back is raised, the two chambers, the trunk, and the
space behind the drawer, are all connected together.</p>

<p>The player may be introduced into the chest through the sliding panel
(<a href="#FIG_6"><span class="smcap">u</span>, fig. 6</a>), at the end. He will then
elevate the false back of the large cupboard, and assume the position represented by
the dotted lines in figs. 3 and 4. Every thing being thus prepared, “the
charm’s wound up,” and the exhibiter may begin his operations by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
opening the door (<span class="smcap">a</span>). From the crowded and very
ingenious disposition of the machinery in this cupboard, the eye is unable
to penetrate far beyond the opening, and the spectator is led to
conclude that the whole space is occupied with a similar apparatus.
This illusion is strengthened and confirmed by observing the
glimmering light which plays among the intricacies of the machinery,
and occasionally meets the eye, when the lighted candle is held at
the door (<span class="smcap">b</span>). A fact, too, is ascertained, which is
equally satisfactory, though indeed for opposite reasons, to the spectator and
the exhibiter, viz. that no opake body of any magnitude is interposed
between the light and the spectator’s eye. The door (<span class="smcap">b</span>) must
now be locked, and the screen (<span class="smcap">i</span>) closed, which being done at
the moment the light is withdrawn, will wholly escape observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
It has already been mentioned, that the door (<span class="smcap">b</span>),
from its construction, closes by its own weight; but as the player’s head will
presently be very near it, the secret would be endangered, if, in
turning round the chest, this door were, by any accident, to fly open;
it becomes necessary, therefore, “to make assurance double sure,” and
turn the key. If the circumstance should be observed, it will probably
be considered as accidental, the keys being immediately wanted for the
other locks.</p>

<p>The opening (<span class="smcap">b</span>) being once secured, and the screen
(<span class="smcap">i</span>) closed, the success of the experiment may be deemed
complete. The secret is no longer exposed to hazard; and the exhibiter
is at liberty to shape his conduct in any way, he may think, most
likely to secure the confidence of the spectators, and lead them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
insensibly from the main object of pursuit. The door (<span class="smcap">a</span>)
may be safely left open; and this will tend to confirm the opinion,
which the spectators probably formed on viewing the candle through
this cupboard, that no person was concealed within it: it will further
assure them that nothing can pass in the interior without their
knowledge, so long as this door continues open.</p>

<p>The drawer stands next in the order of succession: it is opened,
<i>apparently</i>, for the purpose of taking out the chess men, cushion, &amp;c.
but <i>really</i> to allow time for the player to change his position,
(<a href="#FIG_5">see fig. 5</a>.) and to replace the false back and the partition,
preparatory to the opening of the great cupboard.</p>

<p>The machinery is so thinly scattered over this cupboard, that the eye
surveys the whole space at one glance, and it might seem unnecessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to open a door at the back, and to hold a lighted candle there, as in
the former instance; but the artifice is dictated by sound policy,
which teaches that the exhibiter cannot be too assiduous in affording
facilities to explore every corner and recess, which, he well knows,
contain nothing that he is desirous of concealing.</p>

<p>The chest may now be wheeled round for the purpose of shewing the trunk
of the figure; leaving, however, the front doors of the great chamber
open. The bunch of keys, too, should be suffered to remain in the door
(<span class="smcap">d</span>); for the apparent carelessness of such a proceeding
will serve to allay any suspicion, which the circumstance of locking the
door (<span class="smcap">b</span>) might have excited, more especially as
the two doors resemble one another in point of construction.</p>

<p>When the drapery has been lifted up, and the doors in the trunk and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
thigh opened, the chest may be returned to its former situation, and
the doors be closed. In the mean-time the player should withdraw his
legs from behind the drawer, as he will not so easily effect this
movement after the drawer has been pushed in.</p>

<p>Here let us pause awhile, and compare the real state of the chest
at this time, with the impression which, at a similar period of an
exhibition of the Chess Player, has generally been left on the minds
of the spectators; the bulk of whom have concluded that each part of
the chest had been successively exposed; and that the whole was at that
time open to inspection: whereas, on the contrary, it is evident that
some parts had been entirely withheld from view, others but obscurely
shewn, and that nearly half of the chest was then excluded from their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
sight. Hence we learn how easily, in matters of this sort, the judgment
may be led astray by an artful combination of circumstances, each
assisting the other towards the attainment of one object.</p>

<p>When the doors in front have been closed, the exhibiter may occupy as
much time, as he finds necessary, in apparently adjusting the machinery
at the back, whilst the player is taking the position described in
figs. 7 and 8. In this position he will find no difficulty in executing
every movement required of the Automaton: his head being above the
table, he will see the chess board through the waistcoat, as easily
as through a veil; and his left hand extending beyond the elbow of
the figure, he will be enabled to guide its hand to any part of the
board, and to take up and let go a chess man with no other “delicate
mechanism” than a string communicating with the fingers. His right hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
being within the chest, may serve to keep in motion the contrivance for
producing the noise, which is heard during the moves, and to perform
the other tricks of moving the head, tapping on the chest, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the introduction of the player’s left arm into
the arm of the figure, the elbow of the latter is obliged to be drawn
backwards; and to account for, and conceal, this strained attitude, a
pipe is ingeniously placed in the Automaton’s hand. This pipe must not
be removed till the other arrangements are completed.</p>

<p>When all is ready, and the pipe removed, the exhibiter may turn round
the winder, or key, to give the impression to the spectators of winding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
up a spring, or weight, and to serve as a signal to the player to set
the head of the Automaton in motion.</p>

<p>The above process is simple, feasible, and effective; shewing
indisputably that the phenomena may be produced without the aid of
machinery, and thereby rendering it probable that the Chess Player
belongs in reality to the third class of Automata, and derives its
merit solely from the very ingenious mode by which the concealment of a
living agent is effected.</p>

<p>In conducting this analysis, the author disclaims even the slightest
wish or intention to depreciate, or detract from, the real merits of
Mr. De Kempelen: those merits have long since received the stamp of
public approbation; indeed, a more than ordinary share of skill and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
ingenuity must have fallen to his lot, who could imagine and execute a
machine (it matters not by what means the phenomena are brought about)
which has never failed to delight the spectators, by exciting and
maintaining, above all other contrivances of the kind, that pleasing
delusion in the mind, which the Roman poet has so happily denominated
“<i>Mentis gratissimus error</i>.”</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>APPENDIX.</h2></div>

<p>The Knight’s move over the chess board has engaged the attention of so
many scientific men, that I cannot doubt that a collection of different
solutions of the problem will prove acceptable to all admirers of chess.</p>

<p>The Knight’s path is of two kinds—terminable and interminable—it is
interminable, whenever the last, or concluding, move of a series be
made on a square, which lies within the Knight’s reach of that from
which he originally set out—and terminable in every other instance.</p>

<p>Euler published a paper in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin, 1759,
which contains a method of filling up all the squares, setting out from
one of the corners. It also contains an endless or interminable route;
and explains a principle by which these routes may be varied so as to
end upon any square. Montmort, Demoivre, and Mairan, have severally
given solutions of the same problem. These solutions will be found in
the following collection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Observing that the Automaton, under the direction of Mr. Maelzel,
occasionally traversed half the board, I was induced to pursue
the subject, and I found that the move might be performed on any
<i>parallelogram</i> consisting of <i>twelve</i> squares and upwards, with the
exception of <i>fifteen</i> and <i>eighteen</i> squares. The whole board admits
of a great variety both in the terminable and interminable routes.</p>

<p>In describing the Knight’s path, I have preferred lines to figures;
the former giving a clearer idea of the plan pursued, and affording a
greater facility of comparing one route with another, than the latter.</p>
